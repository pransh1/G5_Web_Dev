mapReplica
What it does: Mimics the behavior of JavaScript's built-in .map() method.

How it works:

It creates a new array.

Applies the callback function to each element.

Stores the returned values in the new array.

Use case: When you want to transform each element of an array (e.g., doubling every number).

🔍 filterReplica (incomplete in your code)
What it intends to do: Mimic .filter(), which returns elements that pass a test (true in a condition).

Your version (incomplete): Only logs elements with length > 4 instead of returning a new array.

Proper behavior: Should return a new array of elements that satisfy the condition.

➕ replaceReplica
What it does: Mimics .reduce() method.

How it works:

Starts with an initial value.

Uses a callback to combine each array element with the accumulator.

Returns a single final result (e.g., sum, product, etc.).

Use case: When you want to reduce an array to a single value (e.g., total sum).

If you'd like, I can give you a comparison chart too.
