HOFs
A function that takes another function as argument OR returns a function.


- Examples (Built-in)
Function	Purpose
map()	Transform each array element
filter()	Keep elements based on condition
reduce()	Accumulate values
setTimeout()	Delay execution (uses callback)
addEventListener()	Respond to events

🔄 Array operations (map, filter)

🔂 Loop-less logic

📦 Function factories

🛡️ Middleware (e.g. Express.js)

⏱️ Async tasks (setTimeout, Promises)

🖱️ Event handling


 - Why Use HOFs?
 - Code Reuse

 - Clean, declarative code

 - Powerful with closures

 - Core of functional programming

 - One-Line Definition to Remember:
“A function that works with functions — either takes or returns a function.”
